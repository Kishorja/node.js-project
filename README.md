Deploying Containerized Node.js/Express.js REST APIs on Kubernetes with HPA and Resource Limits

Problem Statement:

In the ever-evolving landscape of DevOps and application deployment, mastering container orchestration and scalability is vital. This project challenges DevOps learners to deploy a containerized Node.js/Express.js application, exposing REST APIs, onto a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, the project requires setting up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and defining resource limits to ensure the application's efficiency, availability, and performance.

Objectives:

Containerized Deployment: Deploy a Node.js/Express.js application within Docker containers.
Kubernetes Orchestration: Utilize Kubernetes to manage and scale the containerized application.
Dynamic Scaling: Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically adjust the application's replica count based on resource usage or demand.
Resource Management: Define and enforce resource limits to optimize resource utilization and stability.

Your focus in this project should be on the following:
Gaining proficiency in containerization concepts and Docker.
Acquiring practical experience with Kubernetes deployment and management.
Understanding and implementing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).
Learning how to define and work with resource limits in a Kubernetes environment.
Recommended Versions:

Node.js:
Recommended Version: 18.x (LTS)
Node.js LTS versions are typically the most stable and well-supported for production use.
Express.js:
Recommended Version: 4.18.x
Express.js 4.x is a widely used and stable version for building web applications and APIs.
Docker:
Recommended Version: Latest stable version
Docker is updated frequently. Use the latest stable version available at the time of your project.
Kubernetes:
Recommended Version: Latest stable version supported by your chosen cloud provider or on-premises setup.
Kubernetes is also frequently updated. Ensure compatibility with your environment and any managed Kubernetes services you're using.
Deliverables
Containerized Node.js/Express.js application code.
Kubernetes configuration files (YAML) for deployment, services, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), and resource limits.
Detailed project documentation explaining the deployment process, HPA setup, and resource limit configurations.
Timeline
Set a realistic timeline for the project, outlining the estimated duration for each phase or milestone. For course ending projects, it should not be more than 72 hours.
Consider the complexity of the project and allocate sufficient time for research, implementation, and testing.
Tasks/Activities List

1. Dockerize the Application:
Develop a Dockerfile to package the Node.js/Express.js application.
Build a Docker image of the application.
2. Kubernetes Deployment:
Create Kubernetes YAML files for deploying pods and services.
Apply the YAML files to create Kubernetes resources.
3. Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):
Configure HPA using metrics like CPU utilization or custom metrics.
Validate the HPA behavior under varying workloads.
4. Define Resource Limits:
Set CPU and memory resource limits for application pods.
Ensure the application performs optimally within the specified limits.
Success Metrics

To gauge the success of the project, the following criteria should be met:
The Node.js/Express.js application is successfully deployed on the Kubernetes cluster and is reachable via Kubernetes services.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of application pods based on specified metrics, demonstrating the dynamic scaling capability.
Resource limits are enforced, preventing resource exhaustion and maintaining stable application performance.
